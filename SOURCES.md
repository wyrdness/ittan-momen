## Note on Sources

### Traditional vs. Modern

When researching ittan-momen, distinguish between:

1. **Traditional regional folklore** (Kagoshima origin)
   - Dangerous, deadly yokai
   - Cautionary tale function
   - Regional cultural expression

2. **Modern popular culture** (GeGeGe no Kitaro influence)
   - Friendly, helpful character
   - National recognition
   - Transformed characterization

Both are valid cultural expressions worthy of study.

## Cultural Sensitivity Note

When researching ittan-momen:
- Respect regional folklore as genuine cultural tradition
- Understand Kagoshima/Kyushu regional context
- Appreciate difference between folklore and popular culture versions
- Recognize modern media's impact on traditional stories
- Consider both traditional and contemporary cultural meanings
