      "summary": "A flying cloth strip yokai from southern Japan. Appearing as a long white cotton cloth (approximately 10 meters/33 feet), ittan-momen flies through the night sky and attacks by wrapping around victims' heads and necks, smothering or strangling them.",
      "full": "Ittan-momen (一反木綿, 'one-tan of cotton') is a dangerous yokai from Japanese folklore, particularly associated with Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Japan. The name refers to a traditional Japanese measurement: one tan is approximately 10 meters or 33 feet in length. This yokai appears as a long strip of plain white cotton cloth that flies through the night sky, seemingly animate with no visible features—no eyes, mouth, or other characteristics. Despite its mundane appearance as simple cloth, ittan-momen is a deadly threat. It attacks humans by silently flying at them and wrapping around their head and neck, smothering or strangling victims to death. The cloth possesses surprising strength and cannot be easily torn or removed once it has wrapped around someone. Ittan-momen represents the Japanese folkloric theme of supernatural danger lurking in everyday, mundane objects—the terror of the familiar made uncanny. While it gained nationwide recognition through the popular manga and anime GeGeGe no Kitaro (where it appears as a friendly character), traditional folklore portrays ittan-momen as a genuinely dangerous yokai. The phenomenon exemplifies regional yokai traditions from southern Japan and represents how even the most ordinary objects can become sources of supernatural threat in Japanese folklore."
