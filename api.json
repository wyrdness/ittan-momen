      "full": "Ittan-momen (一反木綿, \\\"one-tan of cotton\\\") is a dangerous yokai from southern Japan, particularly associated with Kagoshima Prefecture on Kyushu island. Unlike many whimsical or harmless yokai, ittan-momen is genuinely deadly. This yokai appears as a long strip of plain white cotton cloth—approximately **10 meters (33 feet)** long, the length of one traditional \\\"tan\\\" measurement. It has no visible features: no face, no eyes, no mouth, no appendages. Just a simple, featureless strip of white cotton cloth. Yet this mundane appearance belies its lethal nature. Ittan-momen flies silently through the night sky and attacks humans by wrapping around their heads and necks, **suffocating or strangling victims to death**. The cloth possesses surprising strength and cannot be easily torn or removed once it has ensnared someone. This yokai represents a powerful theme in Japanese folklore: **the terror of the familiar made uncanny**—even the most ordinary household object can become a source of supernatural danger."
