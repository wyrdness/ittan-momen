## Overview

Ittan-momen (一反木綿, "one-tan of cotton") is a dangerous yokai from southern Japan, particularly associated with Kagoshima Prefecture on Kyushu island. Unlike many whimsical or harmless yokai, ittan-momen is genuinely deadly.

This yokai appears as a long strip of plain white cotton cloth—approximately **10 meters (33 feet)** long, the length of one traditional "tan" measurement. It has no visible features: no face, no eyes, no mouth, no appendages. Just a simple, featureless strip of white cotton cloth. Yet this mundane appearance belies its lethal nature.

Ittan-momen flies silently through the night sky and attacks humans by wrapping around their heads and necks, **suffocating or strangling victims to death**. The cloth possesses surprising strength and cannot be easily torn or removed once it has ensnared someone.

This yokai represents a powerful theme in Japanese folklore: **the terror of the familiar made uncanny**—even the most ordinary household object can become a source of supernatural danger.

### Tsukumogami Connection?

- Traditional folklore doesn't always specify origin
- Unlike typical tsukumogami, lacks the "100-year" origin story

- No friendly or comedic aspects
- Serious regional warning tale

**Function**:
- Cautionary folklore
- Warning about nighttime dangers
- Regional ghost story

- **Friendly ally** to protagonist Kitaro
- **Transportation** (characters ride on it)
- **Helpful spirit** rather than dangerous threat
- **Comic relief** character

**Impact of Transformation**:
- Brought regional yokai to national attention
- Changed public perception from dangerous to friendly

>
> - **Folklore context**: Serious regional cautionary tale
> - **Modern context**: Beloved pop culture character
> - **Both are valid**: Different cultural expressions at different times
> - **Respect both**: Traditional warning tale and modern reimagining
